Copy everything in [theme.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sprmcell/SprmVision/main/theme.css) and put it in your clients "QuickCss" editor :) 
# What makes this different? 
Well its just ClearVision but with my preloaded configuration and i edited the watermark because it annoyed me
# What do I need to use this?
##### Obviously a modified Discord client (theres multiple)
